# Spam-Message-Detection.
This mini project, titled “Spam Message Detection: A Machine Learning Approach,” focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms to distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) messages. By training models on historical datasets of labelled messages, the system can learn the distinguishing characteristics of spam content.
